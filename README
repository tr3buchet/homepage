I got tired of trying to have a similar home or new tab page as I moved 
back and forth between different browsers, so I made one for myself. This
is the first pass. I plan on extending this to do some introspection of
available icons to make it easier to add more without having to edit the
html.

I host it and point all browsers from several machines at it for a more
predictable browsing experience.

home.html expects a ./icons directory to exist and be populated with
icons which are currently specified in the html.
